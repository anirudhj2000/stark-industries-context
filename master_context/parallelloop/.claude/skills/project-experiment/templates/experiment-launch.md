# Experiment Plan: {title}

**Date**: {date}
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Metrics Framework

### Head Metric
The primary outcome being measured (e.g., Revenue, DAU, Conversion Rate).

{head_metric}

### Sub-Metrics
The levers that affect the head metric (2-6 items).

{sub_metrics}

### Metric Equation
Mathematical relationship between head metric and sub-metrics.

```
{metric_equation}
```

## 2. Current State & Targets

| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Comments |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|
{metrics_table}

## 3. Focus Areas

**Sub-metrics being attacked** (max 2 - can't move too many levers at once):

{sub_metrics_to_attack}

## 4. Hypothesis

For each sub-metric being attacked:
Format: We believe [action] will [improve sub-metric] because [reasoning]

{hypotheses}

## 5. MVP Design

### Quickest MVP
The fastest and least expensive experiment to test and learn.

{mvp_description}

### Experiment Stages
Key phases with what happens in each.

{experiment_stages}

## 6. Resources Needed

Internal & external resources. If money is needed, specify minimum amount to prove hypothesis.

{resources_needed}

## 7. Risk Analysis

### Pre-Mortem
Assume this experiment has failed. Why might that have happened? (min 3 failure modes, decreasing probability)

{pre_mortem}

### Potential BAU Impact
What potential downsides could this experiment have on existing processes?
