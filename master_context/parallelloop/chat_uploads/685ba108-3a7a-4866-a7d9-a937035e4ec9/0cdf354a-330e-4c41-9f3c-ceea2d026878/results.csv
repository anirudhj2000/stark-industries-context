This is the single source of truth for policy data.\n\n2. **Gateway Layer** - Required middleware for API-based policy issuance. Since the FRD mentions automated policy creation, the installment system would route through GW to commit policies to Premium.\n\n3. **PCS (Premium Collection System)** - Currently handles premium collection and settlement. The installment platform's payment reconciliation would need to interact with PCS for agent commission management and payment settlement, though note that PCS is planned to be replaced by Cloranc.\n\n**Agent & Portal Integrations:**\n4. **Agent Portal (SabaiDee)** or the LINE OA rich menu system - The FRD specifies agent access via TMSTH's existing agent LINE OA, requiring integration with current agent authentication systems and producer code validation.\n\n**Payment Integration:**\n5. **KBank QR Payment** - The FRD specifies KBank QR code payment integration with specific reference formats (Ref#1, Ref#2, Ref#3) for payment reconciliation.\n\n**Future Consideration:**\n6. **Cloranc** - Since Cloranc will replace PCS and BMW for unified agent payment management (target 2Q2026), design should anticipate migrating integration from PCS to Cloranc.\n\nSources:\n- Tokio Marine Installment Application and Payment Solution FRD\n- IT Systems Architecture document (source_id: 53e5fa41-814d-420f-852f-70427e7f76a1)\n- Business Processes & Systems document (source_id: db406132-4e5a-422f-9230-7a643d1348b4)""","msg_e3067015-6627-4c75-a762-39fefe91d4ec","","assistant","2025-12-29T07:16:07.773213"
