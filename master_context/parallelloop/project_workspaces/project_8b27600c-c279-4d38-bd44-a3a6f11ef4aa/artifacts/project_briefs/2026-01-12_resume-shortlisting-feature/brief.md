# Project Brief: Resume Shortlisting Feature

**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Type**: PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

A public-facing resume shortlisting feature on the website homepage that gives job seekers instant feedback on their applications. The system uses AI to evaluate resumes against job descriptions and allows shortlisted candidates to immediately self-schedule interviews.

## Problem Statement

Job seekers currently don't receive quick feedback when applying for positions. This creates uncertainty and a poor candidate experience. The lack of immediate response also means qualified candidates may move on to other opportunities before hearing back.

## Goals

1. Provide instant feedback to job seekers upon resume submission
2. Automate the initial screening process using AI-powered evaluation
3. Enable shortlisted candidates to self-schedule interviews without manual coordination
4. Reduce time-to-first-contact for qualified candidates
5. Create a seamless, modern application experience on the homepage

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Job seekers visiting the website to apply for open positions
- Looking for quick, transparent hiring processes
- Expect modern, responsive application experiences
- Value immediate feedback over "black hole" applications

## Scope

### In Scope

- Resume upload widget on homepage
- AI-powered resume parsing and evaluation
- Job description matching algorithm
- Shortlist/reject decision with instant notification
- Self-scheduling calendar integration for shortlisted candidates
- Basic candidate status tracking

### Out of Scope

- Complex configurable scoring rubrics (future enhancement)
- Bias-mitigation features (future enhancement)
- High-volume optimization (100+ applications/day)
- Integration with external ATS systems
- Recruiter/HR admin dashboard (MVP focuses on candidate experience)

## Constraints

- MVP approach: Keep it simple, avoid over-engineering
- No complex integrations required for initial release
- Focus on core shortlisting lifecycle first

## Success Criteria

1. Job seekers receive shortlist decision within seconds of upload
2. Shortlisted candidates can book interview slots without HR intervention
3. Positive candidate feedback on application experience
4. Reduction in time-from-application-to-interview

## Next Steps

1. Define technical architecture for resume parsing and AI evaluation
2. Design homepage widget UI/UX
3. Select calendar/scheduling solution for self-booking
4. Build MVP with core shortlisting lifecycle
5. Test with sample resumes and job descriptions
