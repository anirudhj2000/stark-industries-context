# Project Brief: Website Footer Improvement

**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Type**: PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

A UI refresh of the website footer section with a minimalist design approach, adding an interactive contact form for visitor inquiries.

## Problem Statement

The current website footer needs improvement — both visually and functionally. Visitors currently lack a quick, accessible way to reach out directly from the footer.

## Goals

1. Refresh the footer UI with a clean, minimalist design
2. Add an interactive contact form for basic inquiries
3. Improve overall user experience and visual appeal
4. Make it easy for visitors to get in touch

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Website visitors looking to contact the organization
- May be potential customers, partners, or general inquiries
- Expect a modern, professional website experience
- Want a simple way to reach out without navigating to a separate page

## Scope

### In Scope

- Footer UI redesign with minimalist aesthetic
- Interactive contact form with fields: Name, Email, Message
- Form validation and submission handling
- Success/error feedback states
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Out of Scope

- Newsletter signup functionality
- Social media link integration
- Additional navigation links
- CRM or email marketing integrations (for MVP)
- Analytics tracking on form submissions

## Constraints

- Keep the design minimal — avoid clutter
- Form should be lightweight and fast
- Must work across all device sizes

## Success Criteria

1. Footer looks clean and modern
2. Contact form is functional and easy to use
3. Form submissions are received reliably
4. Positive feedback on visual design

## Next Steps

1. Create wireframes/mockups for the new footer design
2. Define form submission backend (email, database, or API)
3. Implement responsive footer layout
4. Build and integrate the contact form
5. Test across devices and browsers
