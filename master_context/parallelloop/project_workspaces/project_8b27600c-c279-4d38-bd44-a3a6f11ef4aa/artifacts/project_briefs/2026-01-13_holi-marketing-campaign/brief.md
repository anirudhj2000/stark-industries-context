# Project Brief: Holi Marketing Campaign

**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Type**: MARKETING_CAMPAIGN
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

A lead generation campaign timed around Holi (March 2026) targeting B2B tech companies and startups interested in AI solutions. The campaign will run on social media channels with two lead magnets: a free downloadable resource and a webinar registration.

## Problem Statement

Parallelloop needs to expand its pipeline of qualified leads from the tech startup ecosystem. Holi provides a timely cultural moment to stand out with creative, festive messaging while driving meaningful business outcomes.

## Goals

1. Generate qualified leads (emails, signups, demo requests) from tech companies and startups
2. Increase brand visibility among B2B decision-makers
3. Build an engaged audience through valuable content offerings
4. Create a pipeline of prospects for follow-up after the campaign

## Target Audience

**Primary:** B2B — Tech companies and startups looking for AI solutions
- Founders, CTOs, product leaders at early to growth-stage startups
- Tech decision-makers evaluating AI tools and platforms
- Innovation teams at larger tech companies

## Scope

### In Scope

- Social media content calendar for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and Instagram
- Free resource creation (ebook, guide, or template on AI topics)
- Webinar planning and registration page ("Holi Special" themed event)
- Landing pages with lead capture forms
- Creative assets with Holi-themed visuals
- Post-campaign lead handoff to sales

### Out of Scope

- Paid advertising (focus on organic reach)

- CRM integration setup
- Long-term content strategy beyond the campaign

## Constraints

- Timeline: 1-2 weeks before Holi (early-to-mid March 2026)
- Focus on organic social reach (no paid budget allocated)
- Content must balance festive tone with professional B2B messaging

## Success Criteria

1. Number of leads captured (target TBD)
2. Webinar registrations and attendance rate
3. Resource downloads
4. Social engagement metrics (impressions, clicks, shares)
5. Quality of leads passed to sales team

## Next Steps

1. Finalize Holi dates and campaign calendar
2. Define free resource topic and create content
3. Plan webinar agenda and speaker lineup
4. Design Holi-themed creative assets
5. Set up landing pages and lead capture forms
6. Schedule social media posts across channels
