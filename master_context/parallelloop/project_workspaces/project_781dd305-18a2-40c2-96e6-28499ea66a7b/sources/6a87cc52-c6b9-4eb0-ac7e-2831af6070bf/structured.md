@channel had a call with **Param**[^e:param] for feedback and new feature request. The great news is that **Arnab**[^e:arnab] (CEO) and **Rajan**[^e:rajan] (CTO) are now mandating and pushing everyone to use **PL**[^v:PL]!

**Rajan**[^e:rajan] in particular was not a convert earlier.. and a bit skeptical tbh, but now has mandated all **PRDs**[^v:PRD] to be produced via **PL**[^v:PL] only. @Mohit Anand, give them their **PRD**[^v:PRD] template!

**Param**[^e:param] is again praising our meeting transcript quality and rates the platform 9/10.. he also asked when we would be public because they are telling their friends outside of **Leap**[^e:leap] about us, but people can't get to our website -> there is a separate parallelloop.io which is quite fishy. I explained that we are focused on our design partners for now.

No complaints this time around, but instead painting a vision describe below that will completely empower product managers to ship experimental projects to production with CTO's blessings.

### 3. Growth Pod Vision: Direct Landing Page Deployment

**Key Points:**
- **Leap**[^e:leap] has two buckets: **BAU**[^v:BAU] (~60%) and Growth experiments (~40%)
- Growth Pod pain point: After prototype creation (4-8 hours), **PMs**[^v:PM] become dependent on engineering bandwidth
- Proposal: Attach LeapScholar subdomain to **Parallel Loop**[^v:PL] for direct-to-production landing page deployment
- This would allow **PMs**[^v:PM] to deploy landing pages without engineering dependency for experiments
- Discussed Webflow as a reference (no-code landing page builder, pre-AI)
- Requirements include: subdomain pointing to **PL**[^v:PL] servers, potentially needing a database
- Discussed having one dedicated engineer for Growth Pod to review before deployment

**Decisions:**
- **Rajen**[^e:rajan] has approved getting a subdomain for this purpose ("We should definitely do that")
- Plan to have at least one engineer dedicated to Growth Pod for code review
- Start with experiments first, then potentially move to entire **BAU**[^v:BAU] on **Parallel Loop**[^v:PL]

### 4. Subdomain Technical Requirements Discussion

**Key Points:**
- DNS must point to where code is generated (**Parallel Loop**[^v:PL] servers)
- Similar to Figma model where code remains on Figma servers
- Marketing tracking (Google Ads, Meta Ads conversion tracking) needs to be handled
- **Rajen**[^e:rajan] is open to taking code and putting it elsewhere, or building internal infrastructure
- **Param**[^e:param] prefers single pl
