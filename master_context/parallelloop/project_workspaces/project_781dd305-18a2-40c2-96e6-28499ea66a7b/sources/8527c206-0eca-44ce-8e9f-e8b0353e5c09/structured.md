<!channel> had a call with Param for feedback and new feature request. The great news is that Arnab (CEO) and Rajan (CTO) are now mandating and pushing everyone to use PL!

Rajan in particular was not a convert earlier.. and a bit skeptical tbh, but now has mandated all PRDs to be produced via PL only. @Mohit Anand, give them their PRD template! :laughing:

Param is again praising our meeting transcript quality and rates the platform 9/10.. he also asked when we would be public because they are telling their friends outside of Leap about us, but people can't get to our website -> there is a separate [parallelloop.io](http://parallelloop.io) which is quite fishy. I explained that we are focused on our design partners for now.

No complaints this time around, but instead painting a vision describe below that will completely empower product managers to ship experimental projects to production with CTO's blessings.

"3. Growth Pod Vision: Direct Landing Page Deployment
**Key Points:**
• Leap has two buckets: BAU (~60%) and Growth experiments (~40%)
• Growth Pod pain point: After prototype creation (4-8 hours), PMs become dependent on engineering bandwidth
• Proposal: Attach LeapScholar subdomain to Parallel Loop for direct-to-production landing page deployment
• This would allow PMs to deploy landing pages without engineering dependency for experiments
• Discussed Webflow as a reference (no-code landing page builder, pre-AI)
• Requirements include: subdomain pointing to PL servers, potentially needing a database
• Discussed having one dedicated engineer for Growth Pod to review before deployment
**Decisions:**
• Rajen has approved getting a subdomain for this purpose ("We should definitely do that")
• Plan to have at least one engineer dedicated to Growth Pod for code review
• Start with experiments first, then potentially move to entire BAU on Parallel Loop

4. Subdomain Technical Requirements Discussion
**Key Points:**
• DNS must point to where code is generated (Parallel Loop servers)
• Similar to Figma model where code remains on Figma servers
• Marketing tracking (Google Ads, Meta Ads conversion tracking) needs to be handled
• Rajen is open to taking code and putting it elsewhere, or building internal infrastructure
• Param prefers single pl
