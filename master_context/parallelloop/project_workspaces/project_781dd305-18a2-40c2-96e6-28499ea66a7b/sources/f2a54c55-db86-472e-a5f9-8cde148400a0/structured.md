<!channel> had a call with Param for feedback and new feature request. The great news is that Arnab (CEO) and Rajan (CTO) are now mandating and pushing everyone to use **PL**[^v:PL]!

Rajan in particular was not a convert earlier.. and a bit skeptical tbh, but now has mandated all **PRDs**[^v:PRD] to be produced via **PL**[^v:PL] only. @Mohit Anand, give them their **PRD**[^v:PRD] template! :laughing:

Param is again praising our meeting transcript quality and rates the platform 9/10.. he also asked when we would be public because they are telling their friends outside of Leap about us, but people can't get to our website -> there is a separate [parallelloop.io](http://parallelloop.io) which is quite fishy. I explained that we are focused on our design partners for now.

No complaints this time around, but instead painting a vision describe below that will completely empower product managers to ship experimental projects to production with **CTO**[^v:CTO]'s blessings.

### 3. Growth Pod Vision: Direct Landing Page Deployment

**Key Points:**
- Leap has two buckets: **BAU**[^v:BAU] (~60%) and Growth experiments (~40%)
- Growth Pod pain point: After prototype creation (4-8 hours), **PMs**[^v:PM] become dependent on engineering bandwidth
- Proposal: Attach LeapScholar subdomain to Parallel Loop for direct-to-production landing page deployment
- This would allow **PMs**[^v:PM] to deploy landing pages without engineering dependency for experiments
- Discussed Webflow as a reference (no-code landing page builder, pre-AI)
- Requirements include: subdomain pointing to **PL**[^v:PL] servers, potentially needing a database
- Discussed having one dedicated engineer for Growth Pod to review before deployment

**Decisions:**
- Rajen has approved getting a subdomain for this purpose ("We should definitely do that")
- Plan to have at least one engineer dedicated to Growth Pod for code review
- Start with experiments first, then potentially move to entire **BAU**[^v:BAU] on Parallel Loop

### 4. Subdomain Technical Requirements Discussion

**Key Points:**
- **DNS**[^v:DNS] must point to where code is generated (Parallel Loop servers)
- Similar to Figma model where code remains on Figma servers
- Marketing tracking (Google Ads, Meta Ads conversion tracking) needs to be handled
- Rajen is open to taking code and putting it elsewhere, or building internal infrastructure
- Param prefers single pl
