Agenda and order for call later:
(1) Individual priorities for today
(2) Alignment on how to use production/ staging PL env -> PL using PL as priority for next week as P1 (P0: Leap bugs, Licious data project, TMSTH bugs, closing TMSTH roadmap project)
(3) How do we setup projects within PL (e.g. the 10 projects in Linear)?
(4) Walk thru Linear setup-> agree on "project/ feature" priorities taking into account (2). E.g. I think good read/write integrations with key platforms like JIRA/ Linear/ Google calendar/ Google drive required to drive further adoption (to be validated with Leap); next would be overhaul of UI/UX with focus on how to start projects with intuitively, then action points (collaboration).
(4) Any other matter for brainstorming

11 projects (feature buckets for quick reference):
- Project 1: Foundation & Workspace
- Project 2: Context Repository -> E.g. how are we upload images that can be "harvested"
- Project 3: Org & Project Setup
- Project 4: Actions List -> E.g. grouped actions/ threads
- Project 5: AI Assistant (Right Panel) -> E.g. group chat
- Project 6: Basic Artifact Management
- Project 7: Phases
- Project 8: Mobile Application
- Project 9: Permissions, Access
- Project 10: Integrations
- Project 11: Multi-player -> e.g. Collaborating/ editing/ commenting on artifacts by teammates
