### Agenda and order for call later:

1. Individual priorities for today
2. Alignment on how to use production/staging PL env → PL using PL as priority for next week as P1 (P0: Leap bugs, Licious data project, TMSTH bugs, closing TMSTH roadmap project)
3. How do we setup projects within PL (e.g. the 10 projects in Linear)?
4. Walk thru Linear setup → agree on "project/feature" priorities taking into account (2). E.g. I think good read/write integrations with key platforms like JIRA/Linear/Google calendar/Google drive required to drive further adoption (to be validated with Leap); next would be overhaul of UI/UX with focus on how to start projects with intuitively, then action points (collaboration).
5. Any other matter for brainstorming

### 11 projects (feature buckets for quick reference):

| Project | Name | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Project 1 | Foundation & Workspace | |
| Project 2 | Context Repository | E.g. how are we upload images that can be "harvested" |
| Project 3 | Org & Project Setup | |
| Project 4 | Actions List | E.g. grouped actions/threads |
| Project 5 | AI Assistant (Right Panel) | E.g. group chat |
| Project 6 | Basic Artifact Management | |
| Project 7 | Phases | |
| Project 8 | Mobile Application | |
| Project 9 | Permissions, Access | |
| Project 10 | Integrations | |
| Project 11 | Multi-player | E.g. Collaborating/editing/commenting on artifacts by teammates |
