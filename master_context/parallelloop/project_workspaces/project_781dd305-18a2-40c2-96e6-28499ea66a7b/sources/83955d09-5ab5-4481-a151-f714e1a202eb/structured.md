## Thread Content

### Initial Post

**Anirudh Joshi** (07:31 AM, Feb 06, 2026)

@channel had a call with Param for feedback and new feature request. The great news is that Arnab (CEO) and Rajan (CTO) are now mandating and pushing everyone to use PL!

Rajan in particular was not a convert earlier.. and a bit skeptical tbh, but now has mandated all PRDs to be produced via PL only. @Mohit Anand, give them their PRD template! 😂

Param is again praising our meeting transcript quality and rates the platform 9/10.. he also asked when we would be public because they are telling their friends outside of Leap about us, but people can't get to our website -> there is a separate [parallelloop.io](http://parallelloop.io) which is quite fishy. I explained that we are focused on our design partners for now.

No complaints this time around, but instead painting a vision describe below that will completely empower product managers to ship experimental projects to production with CTO's blessings.

### Growth Pod Vision: Direct Landing Page Deployment

**Key Points:**
- Leap has two buckets: BAU (~60%) and Growth experiments (~40%)
- Growth Pod pain point: After prototype creation (4-8 hours), PMs become dependent on engineering bandwidth
- Proposal: Attach LeapScholar subdomain to Parallel Loop for direct-to-production landing page deployment
- This would allow PMs to deploy landing pages without engineering dependency for experiments
- Discussed Webflow as a reference (no-code landing page builder, pre-AI)
- Requirements include: subdomain pointing to PL servers, potentially needing a database
- Discussed having one dedicated engineer for Growth Pod to review before deployment

**Decisions:**
- Rajen has approved getting a subdomain for this purpose ("We should definitely do that")
- Plan to have at least one engineer dedicated to Growth Pod for code review
- Start with experiments first, then potentially move to entire BAU on Parallel Loop

### Subdomain Technical Requirements Discussion

**Key Points:**
- DNS must point to where code is generated (Parallel Loop servers)
- Similar to Figma model where code remains on Figma servers
- Marketing tracking (Google Ads, Meta Ads conversion tracking) needs to be handled
- Rajen is open to taking code and putting it elsewhere, or building internal infrastructure
- Param prefers single pl

### Thread Conversation

@Parallelloop, what is the context here

**Parallelloop** (07:31 AM, Feb 06, 2026)
Please select a project to scope this thread

**Parallelloop** (07:31 AM, Feb 06, 2026)
Thread scope set to **Active Days Counter**. Processing your request...

**Parallelloop** (07:32 AM, Feb 06, 2026)
The thread you're asking about is a summary of a call with Param from Leap, discussing:

**Key highlights:**
1. **Great news**: Arnab (CEO) and Rajan (CTO) are now mandating all PRDs to be produced via Parallel Loop
2. **Platform rating**: 9/10, with praise for meeting transcript quality
3. **Growth Pod Vision**: Leap wants to attach a subdomain to Parallel Loop for direct landing page deployment, allowing PMs to deploy experiments without engineering dependency

**Technical discussion:**
- DNS pointing to PL servers (similar to Figma model)
- Marketing tracking needs (Google Ads, Meta conversion tracking)
- Rajan approved getting a subdomain for this purpose
- Plan to have one engineer dedicated to Growth Pod for code review

Note: This thread appears to be about Leap partnership feedback rather than the "Active Days Counter" project scope. You may want to re-scope this thread to a more relevant project or create a new project for Leap feature requests.

@Parallelloop, create a action for me to investigate the task for DNS pointing to PL server assign the task to me

**Parallelloop** (07:33 AM, Feb 06, 2026)
Action created: Investigate DNS pointing to PL server for Leap subdomain
