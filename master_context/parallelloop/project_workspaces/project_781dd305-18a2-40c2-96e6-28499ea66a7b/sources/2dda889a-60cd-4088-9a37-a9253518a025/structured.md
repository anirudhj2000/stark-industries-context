Agenda and order for call later:
(1) Individual priorities for today
(2) Alignment on how to use production/ staging PL env -> PL using PL as priority for next week as P1 (P0: Leap bugs, Licious data project, TMSTH bugs, closing TMSTH roadmap project)
(3) How do we setup projects within PL (e.g. the 10 projects in Linear)?
(4) Walk thru Linear setup-> agree on "project/ feature" priorities taking into account (2). E.g. I think good read/write integrations with key platforms like JIRA/ Linear/ Google calendar/ Google drive required to drive further adoption (to be validated with Leap); next would be overhaul of UI/UX with focus on how to start projects with intuitively, then action points (collaboration).
(4) Any other matter for brainstorming

11 projects (feature buckets for quick reference):
Project 1: Foundation & Workspace
Project 2: Context Repository -> E.g. how are we upload images that can be "harvested"
Project 3: Org & Project Setup
Project 4: Actions List> E.g. grouped actions/ threads
Project 5: AI Assistant (Right Panel) -> E.g. group chat
Project 6: Basic Artifact Management
Project 7: Phases
Project 8: Mobile Application
Project 9: Permissions, Access
Project 10: Integrations
Project 11: Multi-player -> e.g. Collaborating/ editing/ commenting on artifacts by teammates
